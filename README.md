# Introduction

A beautiful combo of Typescript + React + Mediapipe - a toy project yayy.

I intended to also use Tailwind, but CSS is a little bit more convenient rn, so... Maybe refactor's for another day.

# Environment set-up progress

- Installing Node Package Manager (NPM) version 10.9.2
- For Node.js, the version is v22.15.0
- After installing those, go to the root dir of this repo (which has directories ```src/``` and ```public/```), and run this:
```bash
npm install
```
- There would be many vulnerabilities (**high ones at that**) - but we would fix that another day (probably through npm audit and overwritting dependencies like my Sensei ```Gemini``` taught).

# Plan (thanks, sensei ```Gemini```):

- Dockerize and Deploy it to Vercel cloud.
- Take a look into Tailwind and see if I could manage it.
- Connect the frontend to backend (probably Django) to make a full web app for birthday congratulations.
